### 1d. Course Materials

__Required__: Whitman & Mattord, _Principles of Information Security_,
Fourth Edition, Cengage Learning, 2012. ISBN-10: 1-111-13821-4. 

Rather than buying a paper copy, you may wish to rent the digital version of this text. The digital version is available [here](http://www.coursesmart.com/principles-of-information-security/whitman-mattord/dp/9781111138219) and costs approximately $55.

A copy of the book is available on reserve at Pattee Library.

We will be relying heavily upon [ANGEL](http://cms.psu.edu) for course
communication and information sharing. 

### 1e. Syllabus Updates

I anticipate that we will follow the [schedule](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/blob/master/course_schedule.md), but I may
make adjustments based on what actually happens in class. Be sure to
check with a classmate after an absence to see if assignments have
changed. Remaining in the course after reading this syllabus will signal
that you accept the possibility of changes and responsibility for being
aware of them.

You can see a description of any changes made to this syllabus by viewing [the Commit History on Github](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/commits/master).

## 2. Course Overview

Regardless of the profession in which you work, security, risk, and risk analysis have become more critical. This course relates security planning to _study options_ in the College of IST's Security and Risk Analysis major: __Information & Cyber Security__, __Enterprise Factors & Risk__, and __Intelligence Analysis & Modeling__. Coverage includes information storage/access/networking risks, legal/ethical issues, criminal/terrorist exploits, and threats from global information/intelligence warfare.

Students will learn management of key risks through judicious application of three _control_ "tools": __Programs__ (e.g., security education, training, and awareness), __Policies__ (e.g., laws), and __Technologies__ (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems). Thus, students are exposed to a full spectrum of security activities, methods, methodologies, and procedures. 

The stakes are high, as recent exponential growth in digital information parallels our dependence on information. "Security" (i.e., "freedom from harm or danger") is needed for people (managers/policy makers, end-users/citizens, and related stakeholders), information, and other valuable assets.

### 2a. Course Objectives

As an introductory course, students without prior experience should be successful while more experienced students will also learn something new. Our specific semester question is, "__How do we manage growing threats to personal, enterprise, and national security?__"

Students without prior experience should be able to:

1. Define security, risk, risk analysis, and related terms;
2. Prioritize personal and information assets, and threat/vulnerability pairs;
3. Create a personal information security blueprint; and
4. Describe risk analysis (i.e., critical thinking) and control tools such as policies, education, and technologies (i.e, firewalls, VPNs, access control, and cryptography).

## 4. Assignments

Unless otherwise noted, the submission requirement for assignments is the _beginning of class_ on the due date. Most assignments are collected within ANGEL, although a few may require a hardcopy addition. Submission details will be provided with the assignment post in ANGEL. 

_Also see the ["Assignments" section under Course Policies](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/blob/master/syllabus.md#5b-assignments) for related information (including late submissions)._

### Score Tracking Table

Note that all assignments are required, assignments (including quizzes) are not "curved", and there is no extra credit. Instead, we provide students several ways to demonstrate course material proficiency.

## 5. Class Policies

### 5a. Attendance

You are paying a lot of money to be enrolled in this course, so you owe
it to yourself to attend every class meeting. Students will lose __30 points__ for _each_ unexcused absence, so there are a limited number of classes that you can miss and still earn a passing grade. For example, an 'A-' student with six _unexcused_ absences would receive a final grade of 'C-'. 

A few notes on the absence policy:

* Send an ANGEL email to "All Course Faculty" __no later than 5pm__ on the day of every absence.
* Students are permitted four _personal_ absences; but no personal absences are allowed during _GroupTime_ or presentation classes (weeks 14 and 15).
* For each personal absence after the first two, come see me during office hours.
* Students are required to make up missed assignments within one week.
*  Penn State's [class attendance
policy](http://senate.psu.edu/policies/separate_policy/42-27.htm) states
that students who opt to miss a class to participate in a
University-sanctioned activity are responsible for any work missed
during the absence. If you will be missing class as part of a
University-sanctioned activity, please complete a [class absence
form](http://www.psu.edu/oue/aappm/classabs.pdf).

Please plan to arrive a few minutes early and to remain
until class is dismissed to help avoid disrupting class discussions or
your classmates' concentration.

#### Excused absences

Students who are absent from the university for vacations, religious holidays, or university-approved curricular or extra-curricular activities should plan to complete and submit assignments BEFORE departure (if the date due for the assignment occurs during their period of absence).

The _only_ university-excused absences are:

* Illness (a medical excuse from your health care provider may be required).
* University-approved curricular or extra-curricular activity (prior permission from the instructor is required in this case)
* Emergency military service (excluding regular pre-scheduled activities)
* _Extreme_ family emergency or death (typically not weddings, graduations, or similar festivities) 
* Religious Holiday (notify instructor at the beginning of the semester)

### 5b. Assignments

#### Individual vs. group assignments 
All assignments (quizzes, projects, etc.) are considered individual assignments and NOT group assignments UNLESS _clearly_ specified by the instructor in writing. If you are having problems, come and see us during office hours as soon as possible. Note that with so many students _we do not accept assignments sent to instructors via email or as an email attachment_.

#### Late assignments
Students are responsible for completing their own work and submitting it as directed on the assignment. All assignments must be completed on time to receive credit. Since assignments are noted in the syllabus and are given well in advance, students are encouraged to complete assignments well before the due date. __Late assignments will result in a 20% point reduction__. Note that assignments will not be accepted after feedback or answers have been provided to the class (typically one week following assignment due date).

#### Technical difficulties

To minimize technical difficulty in submitting homework, we strongly suggest using the PSU ITS computer labs. You may use personal computers at your own risk. If you have technical difficulties please come to office hours for help prior to the due date. Plan to complete assignments early since ANGEL crashes occasionally occur. Since late assignment penalties may apply (see above), submit assignments well before deadlines.

### 5c. Quizzes

Schedule each quiz in 104 Pollock Building at [http://www.testing.psu.edu/Students/](http://www.testing.psu.edu/Students/). Each multiple choice/ short answer quiz builds on previous course material, but is technically not comprehensive. A practice Angel quiz should be available five-days before each quiz. See [my study tips](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/Teaching-Common/blob/master/study_tips.md). Excused students have one week to make-up quizzes.

#### Make-up quizzes

Excused students missing one (1) quiz may be allowed to take a comprehensive Make-Up Quiz during finals week, assuming they have: 1) a university-approved excuse, and 2) coordinated the absence and Make-Up Quiz with the instructor.

#### Quiz materials

Students must have a PSU Student ID to take quizzes. Cell phones, pencils and paper (other than specified below) are not allowed during the quiz. An AUTOMATIC Academic Integrity Violation will result if these items are used OR even visible (i.e. lying on desk or floor) during the quiz.

Our Students will be allowed to bring to the quiz a single-sheet (8.5" x 11") front-and-back of personally written notes (i.e., no photocopies, printing, etc.).

Please read [the eTesting center FAQs online](http://testing.psu.edu/Students/), and notices posted in the center. To be admitted, students need to register and bring a student ID. The center is proctored and uses extensive video surveillance.

### 5d. Grade distribution and ANGEL Gradebook

1. In accordance with the [University policy AD 11 on Confidentiality Of Student Records](http://www.registrar.psu.edu/confidentiality/confidentiality.cfm), grades or other student records will NEVER be provided by telephone or to third parties. If you have difficulty in accessing your grades, or if you feel a recorded grade may be in error, you should contact the instructor.

2. Student grades are posted in the ANGEL Gradebook, and students are responsible for monitoring their grades there.

3. Written documentation of any problems related to the assignment of scores must be brought to the attention of the LA's or the professor within one week of the date the scores were first reported to students.

4. CAUTION: Until the end of the semester, the ANGEL Gradebook "ignores" assignments that have zero grades, which may give students an artificially high grade.

### 5f. Registration

The student registration process at Penn State is a two-step process. First, students register for courses. Second, students complete their registration by payment of applicable tuition and fees. Students who have not completed their registration are clearly indicated on all forms of the class list, by the message "Registration Not Complete." Faculty are not obligated to provide instruction or administer assessment to these students. If you are in this status you should contact the Registrar's office immediately.

### 5g. Help

I will do everything in my power to help you do well in this course and to master the material. Do not hesitate to call, e-mail (through ANGEL), or visit me at any time for help. I'm also always happy to have a detailed discussion about how I think you're doing in the class, or why you got a certain grade on an assignment. I'm a firm believer that you learn the most from your mistakes, so I encourage you to closely review and think about the feedback I give you.

## 6. Odds and ends

* I'd like to spend at least five minutes in office hours with every student in the first few weeks of the semester, just so I can get to know you and what you're looking to get out of the class. Please stop by when you are able. 

* The very first item in the Lessons tab on ANGEL is a discussion forum entitled "General discussion." If you have a question or comment that you think might be relevant to the entire class, you can post it there. You may post anonymously in this discussion forum if you wish.
 
* I will record audio and a screencast for each class meeting, and upload the video to [my Vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/mfriedenberg). I'll also post a link to the video in ANGEL.

* Please check ANGEL frequently to ensure that the grades listed in the Gradebook are correct. 

##7. University Policies

Please review these [university policies of interest](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/Teaching-Common/blob/master/university_policies.md).
