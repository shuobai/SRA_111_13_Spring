### 1d. Course Materials

**Required**: Kurose & Ross, *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach*,
Sixth Edition, Addison-Wesley, 2013. ISBN-10: 0-13-285620-4. *Rather
than buying a paper copy, you may wish to rent the digital version of
this text.* The digital version is available [here](http://www.coursesmart.com/computer-networking-a-top-down-approach-sixth/james-f-kurose-keith-w-ross/dp/9780132856256) and costs approximately $56.

A copy of the book is available on reserve at Pattee Library.

We will be relying heavily upon [ANGEL](http://cms.psu.edu) for course
communication and information sharing. 

### 1e. Syllabus Updates

I anticipate that we will follow the [schedule](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/blob/master/course_schedule.md), but I may
make adjustments based on what actually happens in class. Be sure to
check with a classmate after an absence to see if assignments have
changed. Remaining in the course after reading this syllabus will signal
that you accept the possibility of changes and responsibility for being
aware of them.

You can see a description of any changes made to this syllabus by viewing [the Commit History on Github](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/commits/master).

## 5. Class Policies

### 5a. Attendance

You are paying a lot of money to be enrolled in this course, so you owe
it to yourself to attend every class meeting. I will be recording
attendance and will consider your attendance record as part of your
class participation grade.

Penn State's [class attendance
policy](http://senate.psu.edu/policies/separate_policy/42-27.htm) states
that students who opt to miss a class to participate in a
University-sanctioned activity are responsible for any work missed
during the absence. If you will be missing class as part of a
University-sanctioned activity, please complete a [class absence
form](http://www.psu.edu/oue/aappm/classabs.pdf).

In general, please plan to arrive a few minutes early and to remain
until class is dismissed to help avoid disrupting class discussions or
your classmates' concentration.

### 5b. Lateness

Late assignments will be deducted 10% each day. An assignment is
considered late if it submitted after midnight on the due date. The
midnight deadline will be strictly enforced.

### 5c. Help

Short of giving you the answers to the quizzes and exams, I will do
everything in my power to help you do well in this course and to master
the material. Do not hesitate to call, e-mail (through ANGEL), or visit
me at any time for help. I'm also always happy to have a detailed
discussion about how I think you're doing in the class, or why you got a
certain grade on an assignment. I'm a firm believer that you learn the
most from your mistakes, so I encourage you to closely review and think
about the feedback I give you.

## 6. Odds and ends

* I'd like to spend at least five minutes in office hours with every student in the first few weeks of the semester, just so I can get to know you and what you're looking to get out of the class. Please stop by when you are able. I'll include a visit to office hours as credit toward your class participation.

* The very first item in the Lessons tab on ANGEL is a discussion forum entitled "General discussion." If you have a question or comment that you think might be relevant to the entire class, you can post it there. You may post anonymously in this discussion forum if you wish.
 
* I will record audio and a screencast for each class meeting, and upload the video to [my Vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/mfriedenberg). I'll also post a link to the video in ANGEL.

* Please check ANGEL frequently to ensure that the grades listed in the Gradebook are correct. 

##7. University Policies

Please review these [university policies of interest](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/Teaching-Common/blob/master/university_policies.md).
