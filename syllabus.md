### 1c. Class Location and Time

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in 205 IST Building:

* Section 1: 9:05–9:55am (schedule # 943087)
* Section 2: 11:15am–12:05pm (schedule # 943090)

### 1d. Course Materials

**Required**: Whitman & Mattord, *Principles of Information Security*,
Fourth Edition, Cengage Learning, 2012. ISBN-10: 1-111-13821-4. *Rather
than buying a paper copy, you may wish to rent the digital version of
this text.* The digital version is available [here](http://www.coursesmart.com/principles-of-information-security/whitman-mattord/dp/9781111138219) and costs approximately $55.

A copy of the book is available on reserve at Pattee Library.

We will be relying heavily upon [ANGEL](http://cms.psu.edu) for course
communication and information sharing. 

### 1e. Syllabus Updates

I anticipate that we will follow the [schedule](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/blob/master/course_schedule.md), but I may
make adjustments based on what actually happens in class. Be sure to
check with a classmate after an absence to see if assignments have
changed. Remaining in the course after reading this syllabus will signal
that you accept the possibility of changes and responsibility for being
aware of them.

You can see a description of any changes made to this syllabus by viewing [the Commit History on Github](https://github.com/mfriedenberg/SRA_111_13_Spring/commits/master).

## 2. Course Overview

Regardless of the profession in which you work, security, risk, and risk analysis have become more critical. This course relates security planning to _study options_ in the College of IST's Security and Risk Analysis major: __Information & Cyber Security__, __Enterprise Factors & Risk__, and __Intelligence Analysis & Modeling__. Coverage includes information storage/access/networking risks, legal/ethical issues, criminal/terrorist exploits, and threats from global information/intelligence warfare.

Students will learn management of key risks through judicious application of three _control_ "tools": __Programs__ (e.g., security education, training, and awareness), __Policies__ (e.g., laws), and __Technologies__ (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems). Thus, students are exposed to a full spectrum of security activities, methods, methodologies, and procedures. 

The stakes are high, as recent exponential growth in digital information parallels our dependence on information. "Security" (i.e., "freedom from harm or danger") is needed for people (managers/policy makers, end-users/citizens, and related stakeholders), information, and other valuable assets.

### 2a. Course Objectives

As an introductory course, students without prior experience should be successful while more experienced students will also learn something new. Our specific semester question is, "__How do we manage growing threats to personal, enterprise, and national security?__"

Students without prior experience should be able to:

1. Define security, risk, risk analysis, and related terms;
2. Prioritize personal and information assets, and threat/vulnerability pairs;
3. Create a personal information security blueprint; and
4. Describe risk analysis (i.e., critical thinking) and control tools such as policies, education, and technologies (i.e, firewalls, VPNs, access control, and cryptography).
## 3. Course Schedule

## 4. Assignments

Unless otherwise noted, the submission requirement for assignments is the _beginning of class_ on the due date. Most assignments are collected within ANGEL, although a few may require a hardcopy addition. Submission details will be provided with the assignment post in ANGEL. 

_Also see the "Assignments" section under Course Policies for related information (including late submissions)._

## 5. Class Policies

### 5a. Attendance

You are paying a lot of money to be enrolled in this course, so you owe
it to yourself to attend every class meeting. Students will lose __30 points__ for _each_ unexcused absence, so there are a limited number of classes that you can miss and still earn a passing grade. For example, an 'A-' student with six _unexcused_ absences would receive a final grade of 'C-'. 

A few notes on the absence policy:

* Send an ANGEL email to "All Course Faculty" __no later than 5pm__ on the day of every absence.
* Students are permitted four _personal_ absences; but no personal absences are allowed during _GroupTime_ or presentation classes (weeks 14 and 15).
* For each personal absence after the first two, come see me during office hours.
* Students are required to make up missed assignments within one week.
*  Penn State's [class attendance
policy](http://senate.psu.edu/policies/separate_policy/42-27.htm) states
that students who opt to miss a class to participate in a
University-sanctioned activity are responsible for any work missed
during the absence. If you will be missing class as part of a
University-sanctioned activity, please complete a [class absence
form](http://www.psu.edu/oue/aappm/classabs.pdf).

Please plan to arrive a few minutes early and to remain
until class is dismissed to help avoid disrupting class discussions or
your classmates' concentration.

### 5b. Assignments



Late assignments will be deducted 10% each day. An assignment is
considered late if it submitted after midnight on the due date. The
midnight deadline will be strictly enforced.

### 5c. Help

Short of giving you the answers to the quizzes and exams, I will do
everything in my power to help you do well in this course and to master
the material. Do not hesitate to call, e-mail (through ANGEL), or visit
me at any time for help. I'm also always happy to have a detailed
discussion about how I think you're doing in the class, or why you got a
certain grade on an assignment. I'm a firm believer that you learn the
most from your mistakes, so I encourage you to closely review and think
about the feedback I give you.

## 6. Odds and ends

* I'd like to spend at least five minutes in office hours with every student in the first few weeks of the semester, just so I can get to know you and what you're looking to get out of the class. Please stop by when you are able. I'll include a visit to office hours as credit toward your class participation.

* The very first item in the Lessons tab on ANGEL is a discussion forum entitled "General discussion." If you have a question or comment that you think might be relevant to the entire class, you can post it there. You may post anonymously in this discussion forum if you wish.
 
* I will record audio and a screencast for each class meeting, and upload the video to [my Vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/mfriedenberg). I'll also post a link to the video in ANGEL.

* Please check ANGEL frequently to ensure that the grades listed in the Gradebook are correct.
