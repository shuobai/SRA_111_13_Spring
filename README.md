=============

This repo is for SRA 111 (Introduction to Security and Risk Analysis) at Penn State University.

I am using GitHub to keep this course under version control. I hope that this will be useful for my students (since it lets them see the commit history for any changes I make) and for other instructors (who may wish to fork this course and syllabus).
